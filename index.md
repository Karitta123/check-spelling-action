Everyone makes typos. This includes people writing documentation and comments,
but it also includes programmers naming variables, functions, apis, classes,
and filenames.

## Programmer friendly

Often, programmers will use `InitialCapitalization`, `camelCase`,
`ALL_CAPS`, or `IDLCase` when naming their things. When they do this, it makes
it much harder for naive spelling tools to recognize misspellings, and as such,
with a really high false-positive rate, people don't tend to enable spell-checking
at all.

Unlike those traditional spell checkers, this one is able to handle all of those
kinds of tokens.
